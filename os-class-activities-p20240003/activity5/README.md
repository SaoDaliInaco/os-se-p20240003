## Questions

1. In Task 1, why does a producer need to wait before adding a pair to the buffer?
2. In Task 1, why does the consumer need to wait before removing a pair from the buffer?
3. Which semaphore protects the critical section in your particle buffer program?
4. How does your program verify that `P1` and `P2` belong to the same pair?
5. In Task 2, why can the program print letters in the wrong order without semaphores?
6. Which semaphore or synchronization step forces `H` to print before `E`, `L`, `L`, and `O`?
7. What could cause deadlock in either of your simulations?

## Reflection

_What did these simulations teach you about using semaphores for shared resources and ordered execution?_
